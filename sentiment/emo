Happiness is an emotion that an individual can only feel and showcase in actions.

Many things make a person happy in their life. It can be a new home, new car, new dress,
 new toy, etc. But, in my case, I feel happy when I do good in my studies and my teachers,
 parents, and friends compliment me for the same. I want to achieve great success in my studies
 in my life and make my parents and teachers proud. My mother and father have many dreams

 regarding my future, and I would like to fulfil all of those and make them and myself happy. For me, the sense of achievement in life brings happiness and satisfaction. I feel happy when I learn new things in life and get motivated. I have understood that only you can make yourself happy, and I want
 to make myself happy with my hard work, passion, and achieving a sense of purpose in life.
